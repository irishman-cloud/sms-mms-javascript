## Contributing

Although this project is fully available under the MIT license, we do not accept any contributions on this repository. We really love the open-source community, but we have some concerns with user contributed code in our legal responsibility to our clients and customers. That said, we do have several open source projects that we support financially, which you can see on [our website](https://irishman.cloud/).

## License

All of our Client SDKs are fully open-source under the MIT license. This license is one of the most permissive licenses in the open-source world. **Please note:** our server software is proprietary, only the client software that allows people to communicate with our servers is open-source.
